# cueCannon is an app for distributed performing arts

# Roadmap:

## Phase 1: Table reading, recreation
- Polished interface
- Nice stage manager features, like selecting just an act or scene, jumping around, joining as an actor, recasting, and text-to-speech stage directions option
- Invite-only casting
- App store availability
- Custom plays by entering JSON url (remembered)
- Simultaneous productions
- text to speech for actors

## Phase 2: Writer, Curator
- Polished tools for importing content from writers, youtube, AWS audio/video transcribe
- Cue script analysis tool for measuring engagement, line equity, etc
- Internationalization
- Decentralized storage sharing (maybe like Radicle?)

## Later:
### Gitcoin Grant?

### Actual Production tool
Would need to figure out storage 
Make this a tool for an actual production maintaining casting, 
Do we have a broad enough canon to interest people?

### Social features
Would need to figure out storage 
Would need to figure out social moderation / abuse approach
Auditioning? Casting? Sharing plays? Sharing notes / dramaturgy?

### Accessibility features
This would depend on Actual Production tool above
- attaching audio context for writers, directors
- syncing audience tools

### Finance features
- Quadratic performance funding for writers?
- Endowment smart contract?
- Gitcoin-like incentives?
